**TMDybinding** is an open-source Python module for [Pybinding].

## Capabilities

* generate accurate lattices for most used TB models for TMDs
* easily add hopping
* automatic generation of lattice cell with 90-degree corners
* automatic inclusion of SOC terms
* automatic generation of hopping terms taking into account the symmetry of the orbital
* label all the different obrital contributions
* fully compatible with [pybinding] and [KITE]

## Installation

That's easy, just run
``` 
pip install tmdybinding
```
